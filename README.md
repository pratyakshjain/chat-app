# An Introduction To Utilizing Public-Key Cryptography In Javascript

## Open Cryptochat - A Tutorial

Cryptography is important.  Without encryption, the internet as we know it would not be possible - data sent online would be as vulnerable to interception as a message shouted across a crowded room.  Cryptography is also a major topic in current events, increasingly playing a central role in [law enforcement investigations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute) and [government legislation](https://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-cybersecurity/2017/11/10/texas-shooting-could-revive-encryption-legislation-223290).

Encryption is an invaluable tool for journalists, activists, nation-states, businesses, and everyday people who need to protect their data from the ever-present threat of hackers, spies, and advertising agencies.

An understanding of how to utilize strong encryption is essential for modern software development.  We will not be delving much into the underlying math and theory of cryptography for this tutorial; instead, the focus will be on how to harness these techniques for your own applications.

The concepts that we are covering in this tutorial are implemented in Javascript and are mostly intended to be platform-agnostic.  We will be building a traditional browser-based web app, but you can adapt this code to work within a pre-built desktop (using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)) or mobile ( [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)) application binary if you are concerned about browser-based application security.[^1]  Likewise, implementing similar functionality in another programming language should be relatively straightforward since most languages have reputable open-source encryption libraries available; the base syntax will change but the core concepts remain universal.
